<p>
To create a project using Paris/Texas, you need to install Erlang. To do so, we recommand you to use <a href="https://github.com/yrashk/kerl">kerl</a>. But this is not an obligation (of course) and probably the Erlang distribution that's comes with your package manager will do the job. However you need to use Erlang 17 or above. Indeed, Paris needs Cowboy 2 to serve HTTP pages and this one only support Erlang >= 17.

<p>
Once Erlang is installed, you can download the <a href="https://github.com/emedia-project/paris.app/wiki/paris">last version</a> of <code>paris.app</code>. It is a utility helping you to create Paris' application. If you are familiar with Rails, it is similar to the <code>rails</code> tool. For more informations about <code>paris.app</code>, see the <a href="/documentation/paris_app.html">next</a> section.

As you can see in the <a href="/documentation/plugins.html">plugins</a> section of this documentation, it is possible to create controllers with <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> or <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>. If you plan to do so, you must install the appropriate language. See the corresponding documentation for each language.
